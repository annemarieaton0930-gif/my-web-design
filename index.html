<p> I think that I shall never see <br>
A poem lovely as a tree. </p>

<p> A tree whose hungry mouth is prest <br> 
Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing breast; </p>

<p> A tree that looks at God all day, <br>
 And lifts her leafy arms to pray; </p>
 
<p> A tree that may in summer wear <br> 
A nest of robins in her hair;</p>

<p> Upon whose bosom snow has lain; <br>
 Who intimately lives with rain.</p>
 
<p> Poems are made by fools like me, <br>
  But only God can make a tree.</p>
